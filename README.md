# Kanban Board App

This Kanban Board application offers a dynamic way to manage tasks with features tailored for personal productivity and team collaboration. Built with a React frontend and Flask backend, it supports task creation, manipulation, and visualization in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Ensures secure access, with users only able to see and modify their tasks.
- **Task Management**: Users can effortlessly manage their tasks, marking them as complete which deletes the task from the board.
- **Collapsible Tasks**: This feature allows users to streamline their view by collapsing tasks, hiding any subtasks for a tidier workspace.
- **Task Reassignment**: Enables efficient workflow management by allowing users to move tasks between different statuses, reflecting their progress accurately.
- **Subtasks**: Offers the ability to create detailed task management through nested subtasks, enhancing the granularity and organization of tasks.

## Beyond MVP Achievements

In developing this application, I've not only met the basic MVP requirements but also introduced several enhancements to enrich user experience and functionality:
- **Advanced Task Management** with nuanced task statuses for detailed tracking.
- **Efficient Task Reassignment** between different statuses for better workflow management.
- **Durable Data Persistence** with Flask and SQLAlchemy, ensuring reliable data preservation.

These enhancements exceed the foundational requirements, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly task management tool.
